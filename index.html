    <h2>The GD Timeline</h2>
    <p>The GD Timeline aims to document the entire history of Geometry Dash, along with a large selection of articles regarding these events.
      The events on the Timeline are written by multiple authors, and it can be one of you as well!</p><br>

    <h2>GD Assets</h2>
    <p>GD Assets is a little project that has all of the Geometry Dash assets, but neatly organised and upscaled. For now the project is
      about 60% done, the website is fully finished - but some of the files still need orgaisation, animating and upscaling.</p>
